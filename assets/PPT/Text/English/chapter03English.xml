      Alright, we're here!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is the Constellation Zone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So... what now?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let me check your bear-friend's
      note...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It says, "Hold an explosive battle..."
      What does that last part say?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ah! "...an explosive battle with the
      Tetris King!"<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well then.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How the heck is THAT supposed to fix
      your ship?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *thinking sounds* So who the heck is
      the Tetris King...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And where the heck can we find
      him?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Right the heck here!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      WHAT...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      YOU'RE the Tetris King!?<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Whew...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So you're the Tetris King, Tee?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The one and only!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But that doesn't make any sense.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I mean, it's such a bland title.
      You couldn't get a better one?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey! I worked hard for my title!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Besides, it's a more recent
      development.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You see there was a former Tetris
      King, but he sorta vanished into
      thin air.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Poof!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      "Poof"...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Poof.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Right... so, uh... maybe we should
      head back down and re-fuel...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hrrgh! You're right! That could've
      been disastrous! Let's go!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Guess it's our turn to help fix the
      ship.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This "Consolation" Zone is
      beautiful...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's "Constella--" Eh, whatever.
      So what do WE need to do?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Give me that note. I wanna read it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It says: "Two fashionable ladies
      battling in lady-like fashion."<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      "Lady-like," huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      "Lady-like"...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      OH!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *ahem* Lady Amitie, will you do me
      the honour of an hostile encounter?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Lady Ess, it sounds like 'tis the social
      event of the season. I shall RSVP
      at once!<arrow />

    <text>
      Okay, I'm over this!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh, me too.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It WAS fun though, don't you think?
      Next time, let's roll our R's!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipe down. I'm heading back to the
      ship!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>

  <sheet>
    <text>
      Looks like it's our turn to go up
      into space.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It says, "A clash between the two most
      adorable sidekicks."<arrow />

      It's almost musical when you two are
      in sync!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I can't imagine a more adorable
      battle than this~!<arrow />

    </text>
    <text>
      I'm in your debt, everyone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ai is working on the repairs right
      now.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I still don't get why Rulue was acting
      so weird last time...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But at least we took care of one
      problem!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gu-Gugu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Amitie, are you still thinking about
      what happened with Raffina...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Mmhm...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She didn't seem like herself.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm really worried... and we don't
      know where she went.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey there, Amitie!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh?<arrow />

      Glad I finally found ya.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...I had a hunch you'd end up here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Uh, Ringo... who's that?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Him? That's Lemres. He's a friend of
      Amitie's.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And he's pretty good at popping
      Puyos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Lemres~! What're you doing here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Somethin' strange is goin' on in our
      world.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's these things from the sky...
      They're like giant blocks.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Crazy, huh? They're just rainin' down
      on Primp Town.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh!? That sounds like Tetriminos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But why are they on our world!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I couldn't tell ya.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But hey, it gets weirder than that.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They say two strangers showed up
      outta nowhere.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      A green-haired boy with horns... and
      a droolin' shadowy-guy.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What was that!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are you...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...thinking what...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...I'm thinking...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That depends...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do you think...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...it might be...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...the SAME TWO PEOPLE!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hm? What "same two people"?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, just two people we know.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They're always doing nasty things.
      Cruel, even!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Two nasty and cruel people, eh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You rang, Captain?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Definitely not. We were talking about
      two OTHER nasty and cruel people.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hmph! Be more specific next time.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's them. I'm sure of it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, uh...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Say, why don't y'all just come back
      to Primp Town with me?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I mean, we could use a hand cleanin'
      up.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Okie-dokie-eggs-n'-yolky!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Me and Arle and Amitie will go with
      Lemres.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And Ris, Maguro, and the others...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Maybe you could stay here and help
      fix the Tetra?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nice to meet you, Lemres.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm Captain Tee, and this is my
      friend, O.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We'll help too, if that's alright.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What? Why are YOU going? You don't
      have anything to do with this!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think those Tetriminos are related
      to our predicament.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Besides, these three have helped so
      much. It's my turn to help them!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi~Pipi~!<arrow />
    </text>

      right?<arrow />
    </text>

      how to take care of Tetriminos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Easy as pie...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do they go "POP!" like Puyos?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Not quite a "pop," exactly...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      VISUAL DEMONSTRATION!<arrow />
    </text>
