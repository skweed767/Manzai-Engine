      It's such a peaceful day...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So peaceful... and quiet...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nothing ever goes wrong on a
      peaceful day~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hm...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Actually...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Come to think of it, as great as peace
      is... it's actually kinda boring.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It'd be more fun if something exciting
      happened.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Like if all my friends just came
      bursting outta the sky!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ha! But that's nonsense.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Something like that would NEVER
      happen on such a peaceful day,
      right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      OH MY!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What's happening!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think someone's bursting outta
      the sky!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *groan* Th-That hurt...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But hey, I'm in one piece!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Amitie? How'd you get here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Carby, looks like we got warped
      to another dimension.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Arle? Carbuncle? I don't
      understand...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hiya, Ringo! How's it goin'?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Teehee! Hey, Amitie.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let me guess...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You two were in a Puyo Puyo battle,
      huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And you both popped a whole bunch
      of Puyos...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And suddenly, some mysterious power
      picked you up and sent you here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Just like that! POOF!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugugu~GU~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Long time no see, Ringo! Looks like
      you're doing well.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I feel like this happens to us
      a little too often...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's no telling where we might
      end up!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's not such a bad thing is it...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I mean, it brought us to your world,
      right!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yeah, that's the best part about having
      Puyo battles!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *chuckle*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I can't argue with that!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, let's pop some more!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We've been reunited, so let's
      BATTLE!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hold on a second though.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What if, one of these days, we get
      teleported somewhere scary?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? How could it be scary when
      we're all there together!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Good point.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But what if it's somewhere completely
      preposterous?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yeah? Like where!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, I don't know... um... how
      about...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The edge of the who-now?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Psh! Sounds fun to me!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hahaha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Me too! Let's go!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu! Gugu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      If you guys say so...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What was that!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I didn't see anything.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... guys...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh no! What're all those things
      falling out of the sky?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is it a new type of Puyo?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We just got back from our last
      adventure!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      DON'T WE GET A BREAK FROM ALL
      THE PUYO PUYO!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No, no! Look closer!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What're you talking about?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Guys, those aren't Puyos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey! You're right...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They're... blocks?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, just blocks? That's fine.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      WAIT! THAT'S NOT FINE!
      THERE SHOULDN'T BE BLOCKS!
      WHY ARE THERE BLOCKS HERE!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How should I know?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They're really coming down all
      around us, Ringo...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's so many of them!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Look! Some of them fell into a solid
      line. It's so pleasing on the eyes...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      OH MY GOSH, DID YOU SEE
      THAT!? THE SOLID LINE JUST
      DISAPPEARED!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wait... Are you thinking what I'm
      thinking?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Does this mean WE'RE gonna get
      teleported again!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I need you, O.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's time for a routine report.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi! Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *ahem* Captain's report.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is Captain Tee of the SS Tetra.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I am broadcasting this signal via
      Communications Officer O.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The Constellation Zone appears quiet,
      no ripples in spacetime to report.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      End of report.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi-Pipi-Pi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hm... Do we really need to make these
      reports?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I never really questioned them
      before...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pi-Pi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're right. It's my duty to make a
      report.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Even though there's never been any
      problems out here. It's so peaceful
      and quiet!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      HUH!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      PIPI!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What was that, O?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What are the odds... Just as I said we
      never have any problems out here!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is not good!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You hear that?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I heard someone talking, inside the
      playroom!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Did you hear, O?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipipipipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's check it out!<arrow />

  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      I'm super-duper excited to see you
      again someday.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tch! I already told you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      After this, we won't be able to meet 
      up again!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yeah, well, that's just a theory!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Fine, believe what you want.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu... Gugu...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi... Pipi...<arrow />

      GUGU-GU!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      PIPI-PI!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Looks like O and Carby are really
      going to miss each other.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I hate goodbyes. Don't you, Ringo?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nope! Not at all!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? Why?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Because every time, we always find
      our way back together again!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We'll all be reunited again!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, yeah, I guess we do get warped
      around a bit...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thank you, Ringo. You were a big
      help.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Please... take care of yourself?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You got it! I'll take the best care of
      myself!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... right! Good...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      H-HEY! I forgot, I have a present
      for you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's fruit from my house.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      One sec, I'll get it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      S-Sure...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Go after her, Tee.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo is... I mean...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thanks, Arle.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I hope he likes it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, you followed me!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm sorry I startled you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's alright! Try this! This is called
      an apple! It's the best fruit ever.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Th-Thanks, I'll try it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do you want some Puyos too?
      I got some...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wait, they don't exist in your world,
      huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-Yeah...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How about some marshmallows?
      They'll remind you of Puyos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And, um... Tee?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yes, Ringo...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I don't like saying goodbye. I never
      know what to say...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sniff*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Me too.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's agree to not say goodbye.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Please, Tee?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Okay, I won't.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I just want to remember this.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I want our last memory to be smiles.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-Yes, Ringo.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's... It's hard though. I'm really
      sad to see you go.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So NOW Mr. Tough-Guy shows his
      emotions, huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Who am I? "I'll be the Keeper now."<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      H-Hey, stop it! That sounds nothing
      like me.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      "I'm the Tetris King!
      Wha-Wha-Wha...!"<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      R-Ringo...! Give me a break. Hahaha!<arrow />
    </text>

    <text>
      You're one to talk, Ringo.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? Arle...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yeah! Really, Ringo!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      When you were fighting Tee, you were
      so serious!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, that's a lie!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How long were you standing there?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That was a tense battle...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Urgh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, I'm glad they all enjoyed
      watching us!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hahaha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...I'm going to miss you all.<arrow />

    <text>
      Me too, everyone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We haven't had a good misadventure
      in forever.<arrow />

    <text>
      Yep, I'm glad we were all together.<arrow />
