      Hey, we got to Primp Town much
      quicker than I expected!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It was convenient we found a path
      leading right here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Heh... I told ya I knew the way!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So this is Primp... And it IS overrun
      with Tetriminos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi! Pipi-Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I agree, O. This is definitely the
      strangest world we've ever seen.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yep! Welcome home!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's tons o' fun here!  Wish we had
      time to go sightseeing!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...But we really ARE overrun with
      Tetriminos...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Th-This place is a mess...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, then let's get to work, team!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      First up, Tetrimino cleaning duty.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And second, we figure out why this
      is happening.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Not to go in reverse order... but I
      can tell you why this is happening!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh no! It's him!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's the Dark Prince!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Whahaha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Sounds like my precious Arly and my
      precious Carbunny need help.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Enter... me! The strong, strapping,
      madcapping monarch of the dark!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The majestificent... ... ...Dark Prince...
      ...at... ... ...your service...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      NO THANK YOU!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      GU! GU-GU!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh!? H-H-Hey, I-I wasn't done with
      my introduction yet.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yes, you were!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I knew we'd find YOU here...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *princely chuckle*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So you want to know why the
      Tetriminos are hitting Primp, huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, listen up.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Two very different dimensions seem
      to be merging into one.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...And thus, it's transforming both
      worlds.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And somehow, a few people have
      gone a little kooky from this.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But if you beat them at Puyo Puyo
      and Tetris, you might cure them.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And now... to reveal who is behind the
      merging of the worlds... Mwahaha...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh* Let me guess.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's you, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      H-Huh!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You probably wanted to have some
      fun, is that it?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You got bored, so you caused a whole
      bunch of chaos. Big whoop.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu! Gugu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What!? You suspect ME of all
      people...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's definitely just the sort of evil
      plan YOU would concoct.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm flattered! But please believe me,
      Arly, it wasn't me this time.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No matter where I travel to...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No matter what, you're always there
      to cause trouble.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Of course I don't believe you're
      innocent!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gu-Gu-Gu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm wounded by your cruel, cruel
      finger-pointing.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *princely cry* I am the victim here!
      You two are ganging up upon me!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Whoa... I think he's actually crying!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Say, how 'bout we use this chance to
      clear some Tetriminos?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm way ahead of you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Time for your punishment!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      GU~GU~GU~GUGUGU!<arrow />

    <text>

      Gugugu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You guys stay here. Me and Carby'll
      track him down.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He was acting so strange just now...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm worried! See you all later!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey! Dark Prince! Wait up!<arrow />

      Ringo, what in the universe did we
      just observe?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh, don't worry about it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Arle's on the job, so it should turn
      out alright...ish!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That sounds reassuring.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      C'mon, we got some inspectigating
      to do!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think we should start at the Magic
      School.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's where I left the others.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Maybe they found somethin' out
      since I left!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Wh-Who's there...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No! ...Stay back! BACK!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Someone's up ahead...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And I'd say he looks pretty
      frightened.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? It's Klug!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What's wrong?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh! Hello there, Amitie.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      N-N-N-Nothing important...
      It's just...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, she was acting... s-stranger
      than normal...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I tried to reason with her... but she
      spooked me! I ran off kicking and
      screaming.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Er, I mean... I WALKED off, at an
      average pace, entirely of my own
      accord.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo, who's that?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pi-Pi...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, that's Klug, one of Amitie's
      friends.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Start over. Who scared you away?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      H-Hey! I didn't get scared! Let's,
      uh... let's keep our facts straight.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      If you're going to twist my words,
      maybe I don't want to answer your
      questions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is this REALLY the time to get
      defensive?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *evil laugh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh no! *tremble* It's her!<arrow />

      ...'C-'C-'C-'Cause now I need s-someone
      to h-hide behind!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Everything is so chaotic. What's
      going on?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Didn't that Dark Prince fellow
      mention this?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This girl is acting kooky, right?
      She's not herself.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So that means we should battle her,
      correct?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? You're right!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'll look after Amitie n' Klug.<arrow />

      *evil laugh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So you will not step aside then?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's an unnatural energy in you...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Shouldn't you also embrace the
      coming chaos?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Raffina, that's a bad idea.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You need a new plan.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      People don't like chaos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well then, in that case...<arrow />

    <text>
      You took off so fast, we were worried
      we'd lost you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But it looks like you've solved the
      problem on your own!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You can say that again!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But, um... Whew!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is something wrong?<arrow />

    <text>
      N-No, I'm not.<arrow />

    <text>
      You need rest.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm... I'm fine...<arrow />

    <text>
      Hey, you can catch up with me and
      Tee later, okay?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Why don't you get a little shut-eye
      first? Sig, will you watch her?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No, no I'm fine...! Maybe I'll just...
      *yawn* ...get a little shut-eye first...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thank you, Sig.<arrow />
    </text>

      I am Schezo the dark mage.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And I demand you stop screaming
      "creeper" at once!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I prefer you to scream my name when

      I don't take that lightly.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There are less besmirch-y ways to
      summon me, you know!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are you... angry at me?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What do you think!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You expect me to answer to "creeper"
      like it's no big deal?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The time has come for me to clear
      my reputation... by assaulting this
      young girl!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      So what'd you need me for, anyhow?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We're looking for the Dark Prince.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is he wrongdoing again?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's the reason these Tetriminos
      are falling on Primp Town!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And also, that's causing Rulue to
      act kinda kooky.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gu-Gu-Gugu...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Rulue... acting kooky, you say?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm going to teach that Dark Prince
      a lesson he won't forget!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I don't mean to be a Prince's
      Advocate, but are you sure he's
      to blame?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      "Princess Advocate"? What are you
      even saying...? Stop being weird.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Urgh! Never mind. Let us find him.
      We should probe the area!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Really!? You'll help us!?
      --Hey, wait up!<arrow />

      Shoosh! It's Rulue...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Arle, you said she's being kooky,
      right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yep-siree! And the Dark Prince is
      behind it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nope-siree. Sorry.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The Dark Prince is not our foe this
      time.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Feel her magic aura... Embrace your
      training.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That power is not of this world.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So... what are you saying?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Someone--or something--else is
      making her act this way.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *gasp* OH NO!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      B-But I was so cruel to the Dark
      Prince earlier!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Meh! He probably deserved it
      anyhow.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let us focus on Rulue. We should
      advance on her slowly...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You stay put, while I make advances
      on her!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      A-Are you hatching some brilliant
      gameplan?<arrow />

    <text>
      Just watch and learn...<arrow />

    <text>
      Rulue!<arrow />

    <text>
      *evil laugh, continued*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're interrupting my laugh and my
      master plan.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I will turn this dimension into
      smithereens!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tsk! Tsk! It's a good thing HE hasn't
      seen you like this...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You know interdimensional chaos is
      NOT what he looks for in a girl...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tsk! Tsk! Your crush, the Dark Prince,
      would be so disappointed.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hmph! This isn't intended to be a
      brilliant gameplan or something,
      is it?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Because it is far from brilliant.<arrow />

      Hey, Dark Prince, do you still wanna
      tell us who's to blame?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, just think about it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Someone is behind merging the
      dimensions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So they must be powerful, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      BUT! They must also be able to travel
      between dimensions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Someone who travels between

    </text>
    <text>
      Do we know someone like that?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's laughing at you, beyond the

      It's too high for you to ever reach.

    <text>
      WHAT!? You've already got one!?

    <text>
      Yep, and she's all fixed up by now,
      I'm sure!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well then, in that case, you'll get
      there just fine.<arrow />

    <text>
      BUT ALAS! I cannot join you. My place
      is here, in this world.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Someone must finish clearing all
      these Tetriminos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And someone must help rebuild... Even
      if it means all by his princely self...<arrow />

      Great! I'm sure you'll handle it.
