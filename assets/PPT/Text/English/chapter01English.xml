      This is not good!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I got teleported from home.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...And I'm in some weird place.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...And I'm all alone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is SO not good!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hm...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Captain's report.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      A girl in a non-form-fitting outfit has
      materialized aboard the SS Tetra. <arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I believe she is currently performing
      an improvised alien comedy routine.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi-Pi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Don't be hasty, O. Something about
      this seems... not normal.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I am unsure what our next course of
      action should be.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... *throat clear*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-You there.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's wearing some really
      tight-fitting clothes.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And he's trying to talk to me...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wait...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      SOMEONE sent those squarish things
      that brought me here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I bet that someone was YOU!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Sounds like the only solution here is
      that we should battle!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      W-Wait, what?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The girl is in a panic, but perhaps a
      battle might be the best course.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I shall fight her until she calms
      down!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipipipipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So... you know how to match them up
      and make them disappear too...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Of course I do. Are you ready?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's do this!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tetris time!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Puyo Puyo time!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      IT'S ON!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      WHAT...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She doesn't play Tetris!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He doesn't play Puyo Puyo!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But that's...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      OH NO! We're starting!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      We were still able to battle, even
      though he was using blocks instead
      of Puyos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And he's not too bad!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What were those...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I have never seen those jelly-things
      before...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? You don't know what a
      Puyo is?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I do not. I have a great deal of
      questions for you...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But first, let me introduce myself.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I am Tee, and I am the captain of
      this vessel, the Starship Tetra.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I have the ability to control and
      clear Tetriminos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ah ha... So that's what Tetris is.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, my name is Ringo!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And I can pop Puyos to make them
      disappear.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So those round things are Puyos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Uh-huh, and sometimes when
      we pop them, it sends us off to
      other worlds.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's sorta... kinda... like... well...
      a PORTAL!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Anyhow, I'm sorry for barging in like
      this. Wasn't on purpose, I swear.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But... uh... maybe you can help me?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hm...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's strange.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now that we've battled, I feel like
      I can trust you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Really!? Me too...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Say, Tee, I was with a few of my
      friends before I arrived here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's a chance they were also sent
      to this ship.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They might be just as panicked as
      I was...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Roger. Let's go search the SS Tetra
      together!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thanks, Tee!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      This is the last time I'll ask. It's a
      simple question...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Who are you? What is a Puyo? Are you
      here alone? Where are your friends?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How did you get here? And where are
      you from? And WHY are you here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And also... are you aware that you're
      kinda a huge WEIRDO?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wahhh! My brain hurts! Look, I
      already told you...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Everything was fine, and then I just
      got whooshed away while popping
      Puyos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      By the way, I'm Amitie, and I'm gonna
      be a great magician one day!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      A... what!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Magic-schmagic!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Look, lady... FIRST, you interrupt
      my nap.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      NOW, you're just blabbering
      nonsense!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm so mad, I want to smack you with
      a Tetrimino!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      MEEP!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I had hoped we'd find her first.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pi-Pipi-Pipi...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo, that girl in the red hat...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is that one of your friends?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yep, that's Amitie.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She can be a handful sometimes.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And hey...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What about that other girl? She seems
      kind of abusive, don't ya think?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, that's Ess.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She's one of my crew. ...And also a
      handful sometimes.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, if you're the Captain, can't
      you make her stop...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... the thing is... You see, uh...
      Well, the... uh... sh-short answer is...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      N-No. No, I can't.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Piii...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wow, sounds rough...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Ess!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee! Finally! We need to talk!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What is it?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It is the Captain's sworn duty to
      make sure I can nap in peace!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And that means we need to detain
      weirdos BEFORE they roam free,
      wouldn't you agree?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ess, did it ever cross your mind...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I can't be everywhere!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, then you're useless!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What did you just say?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh my! Another person in strange
      clothes.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're Amitie, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Please, try and calm downâ€¦<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'll show you "calm"! I CHALLENGE
      YOU TO A BATTLE!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hmph...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I guess that's the quickest way to
      settle this.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Bring it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tetris!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Puyo Puyo!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      LET'S BATTLE!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Wh-What were those... blocks?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh, who cares! Let's do that again!
      That was fun! *giggle*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You've calmed down a bit.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Amitie?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Ringo!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm so glad you're alright!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So we can go into the details
      later...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...but that boy over there in the
      ridiculously tight jumpsuit is Tee.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's going to help us out!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's great! Thanks, Tee! I love
      the ridiculously tight jumpsuit!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're welcome.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Next up, let's go look for Arle!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is this "Arle" a friend as well?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, she's the bestest there is!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Just listen for a "Gugu." That means
      you're close!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... a "Gugu"...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Did someone say "Gugu"...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think I heard a "Gugu" earlier!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Alright.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Then, let's get a move on!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi-Pi-Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      *whine*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      YIP YIP YIP!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hahaha...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What's wrong, doggy? Play with
      us~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yes, play with us, doggy~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We haven't pulled any pranks yet,
      right, Jay?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's right, Elle!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We didn't lace his food with hot
      mustard...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We certainly didn't pelt him with
      live frogs...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We haven't sprayed him with the
      hose...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And we never even played tug-o'-war
      with his tail...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We've behaved ourselves all day!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      YIP! YIP! Rrrgh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, my...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I know we're supposed to find
      Arle...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But those two are bullying a helpless
      puppy!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hm...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are you sure that's a puppy...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, I guess, more importantly...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, what's going on here? Who
      are they?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Those three are also part of my crew.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The twins are Jay and Elle. They love
      their pranks.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And then there's the one trembling
      in the corner...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's Ai, the SS Tetra's chief
      engineer.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's your... engineer?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How does your ship stay afloat?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Don't worry. He's a bit jumpy sometimes
      but he comes highly recommended.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Jay! Elle! Leave him alone!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But... But...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We haven't done anything!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ai saw something that spooked him.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And now he's too scared to move!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh? And what did he see?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He said it was a little yellow guy
      that says, "Gugu"!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And some strange girl was with him.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But that's silly-talk...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hahaha! Yeah, Ai is silly!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is that...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Sounds like Arle alright.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ai, where did the girl go?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Rrgh! Rrgh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      YIP! YIP! YIP!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pi-Pi-Pi...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We're getting nowhere.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I shall put him at ease... WITH A
      TETRIS BATTLE!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *WHINE!*<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Captain, I apologize for losing my
      composure.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are you better now?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Indeed. It was a splendid battle, and
      I've returned to my senses.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now then, as for the peculiar duo
      I saw...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I believe they ambled off in that
      direction.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Excellent! Thanks, Ai.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Whoa...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Something wrong, Ringo?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No, it's just... he really made a
      night-and-day recovery. It was
      really impressive.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I didn't have a chance to give a proper
      reaction because I was waiting for a
      good moment!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, now we know where Arle is!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Alright, let's go!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi-Pi-Pi!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      I have you surrounded! Do not
      resist!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      H-Hey... D-Don't come any closer.
      I'm warning you...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugugu...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You will do as I say.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Surrender yourselves at once.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Get away! I'll never give in!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Someone! Help me!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What's he doing to Arle?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh my gosh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What's going on?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That big, round robot's got Arle
      trapped!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Arle, you hear me? Run! He's probably
      too fat to chase you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Run! Run! Run! *giggle*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um, Amitie, he looks like he's pretty
      athletic...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Arle, don't move. We're gonna
      rescue you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo? Amitie?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm so happy to see you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Us too! I'm glad you're alright.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What was that piece of junk trying to
      do to you?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Excuse me...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It was horrible! He had this whole list
      of demands...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That sounds awful.<arrow />

      What sort of "list of demands"!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh my... He made me so
      uncomfortable, Ringo.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He said I couldn't run in the hallway!
      And not to drag my feet!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He said I need to eat my veggies, and
      I can't play with my food!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He even lectured me about *gulp*
      proper hand sanitization techniques!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh dear!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's not at all where I thought
      this was headed...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You see what I mean? Ringo, you
      KNOW how much I hate all that
      "manners" stuff!<arrow />

      Gugu-Gu!<arrow />

      Meet Zed, the last member of the
      Tetra's crew.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He means well, but I guess he can
      overdo it some days.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So this thing's your friend...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's correct.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So... you're gonna expect the
      same list of demands too, huh!?
      Is THAT it!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... No.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We shall do BATTLE before I ever give
      in to your oppressive demands!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well... *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Have it your way!<arrow />

    <text>
      Good luck, Tee!<arrow />

      our problems...<arrow />

    </text>
    <text>
      You betcha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But wait! You weren't popping Puyos
      just now!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Affirmative.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I know, right? I was surprised at
      first too.<arrow />

    <text>
      He calls the whole thing "Tetris."<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oooooh~!<arrow />

    <text>
      We've been to so many worlds, but
      there's always something new to
      learn, huh?<arrow />

      The world's a big place, isn't that

      What matters is we're all together

    </text>
    <text>
      Now, we just need to figure out how
      to get home...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Usually, we just pop Puyos until it
      teleports us back. Um... let's pop
      some more?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu!<arrow />

    <text>
      You don't seem too concerned by our

    <text>
      Huh...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee! Wh-What's happening?<arrow />

    <text>
      Huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm not sure what you mean.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      These blobs just showed up out of
      nowhere!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And we've lost control over the
      Tetra's cockpit!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh no...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I feel like we run into these sorts
      of problems a lot when we travel
      around...<arrow />

      Th-There's nothing I can do. They're
      all over the controls!<arrow />

      Pipipipi! Pipi-Pipi! Pipi-Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What's that...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He says we're caught in that planet's
      gravitational pull.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Everyone, brace for impact! We're
      going to crash!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Did you say... "crash"?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *slightly-louder-than-
      average-screaming*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Everyone! We need to pop these Puyos
      as ASAP as possible!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu! Gugu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Right! Let's DO IT!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo! I want to help!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Teach me how you pop Puyos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You got it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And later, teach me how to
      clear those Tetriminos, 'kay?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...I mean, only if we survive, of
      course.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh* Ringo...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm fairly sure you just jinxed us.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We'll be fine! All you need to do is
      connect four Puyos of the same
      color! That's all.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's some other stuff, like
      Garbage Puyos and Chains...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But I'm sure you'll figure it all out,
      EASY-PEASY!<arrow />

    <text>
      That's so helpful of you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pshh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's not about being helpful.
      Clearly, if this starship crashes,
      I'm in trouble too.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You are the most clueless girl in the
      entire universe.<arrow />
