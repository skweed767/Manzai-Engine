      We're back at the crash site...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And it looks like the Tetra's in good
      shape!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wow...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They actually fixed her up!<arrow />

      Pipipi!<arrow />

    <text>
      *chuckle*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Much of the thanks goes to my new
      friend, Risukuma, here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He was instrumental in the repairs.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Bah, don't mention it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's kind of ironic, when you think
      about it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We became such close friends getting
      your ship ready...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But that just means saying goodbye is
      even harder now.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's true, but no matter where
      we travel among the stars...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'll never forget the fun we had!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And I'll miss you, Ess! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tch! I'll miss you too. I mean...
      probably.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You were a big help fixing the Tetra!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You mean it? ★ You'll... You'll...
      really miss me? ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, don't twist my words.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I MIGHT miss you, but not for another
      week or so! Sheesh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ess n' Maguro, sittin' in a tree~!<arrow />

      Maguro n' Ess, sittin' in a tree~!<arrow />

    <text>
      P~U~Y~O~I~N~G~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's the dumbest song I've ever
      heard, you two!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Doesn't sound so horrible to me! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Captain, it is time for us to depart.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Right. Thank you, everyone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      T-Take care, Tee.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Aren't we forgetting one small
      detail...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You are NOT leaving us behind!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pi-Pipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But Tetriminos are still falling...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And there's still Puyos in the
      Constellation Zone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This mystery is still wide open, as far
      as I see it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh my gosh, she's right!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I thought our mission was all over!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Sounds like it's just getting
      started... ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The Dark Prince said something
      interesting, for once.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The culprit is someone who can travel
      between dimensions... I wonder...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, I'd like to go with and look for
      him.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I have a feeling our part in this
      mission isn't over yet.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is that alright?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You bet it is!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's get this sideshow on the road!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? Y-You're coming too?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Naturally.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You expect me to sit around here all
      day?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, then it's settled!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Prepare to depart!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      SS Tetra, to the stars!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's so much space out here in...
      space!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, the being we're looking for is
      named Ecolo.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Errh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's out here somewhere.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      "Somewhere" is a pretty large area.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yeah, any idea where to start?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tch! Um, guys...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think the answer's been under our
      noses this whole time.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      THERE HE IS!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Egads!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Th-That blob's been staring at us this
      whole time!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      THAT'S Ecolo...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipipipipipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Didn't someone mention a drooling
      guy?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How dare you sit there and eavesdrop!
      ...And drool all over!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hrmmm...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, he's getting away!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Get back here, Ecolo!<arrow />
    </text>

    </text>
    <text>
      *screaming loud enough to be heard
      in the vast vacuum of space*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I hate big, ugly fish!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, excuse me for havin' some

      Not to play "koi," but I'm not sure
      actually.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I was just doin' my thing, and I felt
      somethin' tuggin' me. So I came!<arrow />

      for a new potion!<arrow />

    </text>
    <text>
      Have a nice day! Ehehe!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Does she... even realize that she's up
      in space...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's impressive.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She's very focused, you might say.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are you two done?<arrow />

    </text>
    <text>
      And where'd all those weird blocks
      come from?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's no water... and no food...<arrow />

      RRGH! WHY'S NO ONE HERE TO SEE

    <text>
      Oh! Yeah, keep on going, and make a

    </text>
    <text>
      Then, head left when the road ends.
      Can't miss it!<arrow />

    <text>
      Gee, thanks!<arrow />

      You all looked like you were having
      fun!<arrow />

    <text>
      And you were playing with all those
      colored blocks!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I just wanted to play too!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      WHAT!?<arrow />

    <text>
      We had a good game of hide-n'-seek,
      didn't we?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      THAT'S why you were running away?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I had so much fun!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's have more fun together!<arrow />

    <text>
      Look, Ecolo...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I want you to sit there and think
      about the trouble you caused.<arrow />

    <text>
      What trouble...?<arrow />

    <text>
      Eh?<arrow />

      I didn't merge the two dimensions,
      Ringo.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-You didn't?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, guess we jumped to
      conclusions, huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, of COURSE you did, dingbrain!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The bad man has powers similar to
      mine.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's known as the Keeper of
      Dimensions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The "Keeper," huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He lives way out at the edge of
      spacetime.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's his job to make sure the worlds
      stay separate.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Someone hasn't been doing his job,
      if you ask me.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The edge of spacetime...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's where we'll find the Keeper of
      Dimensions?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I guess...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, you listening to me...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Ringo!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It isn't so easy traveling that far.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You'll need the power of Puyo Puyo
      AND Tetris.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You have to use them both!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      If you do it just right, you can warp
      there!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But... how?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, silly, you can't get there with
      your current power!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nope! You all need to get MUCH
      stronger-er...er!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How do we do that?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *mocking sounds*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-Why do you single ME out and
      be rude?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Not sure.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Th-That's not a good reason...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Next, you're gonna say I need a
      reason to bury you in Puyos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Bring it! I don't get buried
      that easy! You'll see!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      H-Hey, I won...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Boo! You're no fun!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh well, good luck!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      See ya, Ringo!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, I'm not done with you yet!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...It's like talking to a spoiled child!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's look on the bright side.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He DID give us a clue, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's see what everyone thinks.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So that's where we stand.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      To reach the edge of spacetime, we
      need to get stronger.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wow, I had no idea that even
      existed!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So how do we get stronger?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... no clue!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's easier said than done.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I wish it weren't so vague.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, my, are we in trouble...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh...? OH!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *giggle* Good day, everyone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I see some new faces, meow!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Professor Accord!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Shouldn't you be back at Primp
      Magic School?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Why are you out here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, I was just passing by.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wow!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Speaking of which...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Did I hear you were trying to become
      stronger?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-Yeah, all of us are...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *giggle* Never fear!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I had a sneaky feeling this might
      happen.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So I built you all some training
      grounds!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You... built us a place to train?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Without even knowing we'd need
      it...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're the best!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Does no one else find this oddly 
      convenient? ...No? Just me?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I bet if we all go there and battle
      each other, we'll all get stronger!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh? That would be meowtrageous!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *giggle* Indeed! No, instead, you'll
      have to face your own memories.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Our... what now?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You'll be training against illusions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Close friends, powerful rivals, and
      everyone in between!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      If you beat them all up, it'll turn
      YOU more meowerful!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm not sure I get it...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But it sure sounds like a hoot!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      C'mon, everyone, what're we waiting
      for!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *giggle* Safe travels~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I believe in meow!<arrow />
