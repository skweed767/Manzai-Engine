      D-Did it work?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, I guess so. This must be the edge
      of spacetime.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But where's the Keeper?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Right here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-You're the Keeper of Dimensions!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's right.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, do you know this guy?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is Ex, the former Tetris King.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm beginning to remember...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's the one I send my captain's
      reports to.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You didn't think to tell us this
      sooner...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      S-Sorry...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's all so confusing!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      My memory's mostly a blur!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You weren't meant to remember
      me, Tee.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What do you mean?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I travel freely between dimensions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I don't belong to any world.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And therefore, people never
      remember me.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I see...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Ex? ...Um, Keeper?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Why are you merging the two
      worlds?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-Yeah...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We had fun meeting new friends
      and all...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But aside from that, this whole thing
      has been a mess.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They're right!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're a horrible Keeper! Do your job
      next time!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm sorry, everyone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But it's beyond my control.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey! Get back here! I'm not finished
      with you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What's happening...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's a whole swarm of Puyos AND
      Tetriminos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We have to make them all disappear!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Help me!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      We did it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...But we lost Ex.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm over here. Follow me.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey! Wait up!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      While I was Tetris King, I learned I
      could cross between worlds.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And from then on, I became the
      Keeper of Dimensions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But my days were spent in solitude.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      My only companionship came from
      hearing Tee's reports.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I was all alone, watching over the
      universe...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Protecting the border between
      worlds...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And then...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, he ran off again!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      O, did you know about this the whole
      time?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're the one who sent Tee's reports
      to him, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gu...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I see.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, Ex sounds like he was pretty
      lonely.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi...! Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What's that?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's more Tetriminos incoming!
      ...And Puyos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi! Pipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu! Gugugu!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Alright, we can handle these.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's go, Carby!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugugu!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      We're safe now!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now then...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thank you. Just a little farther now.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? Hey, stop running off!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      C'mon, Carby!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi...<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      I sat here for years, listening to
      Tee's reports.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I was sad.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I was sad I was alone. I was sad I'd
      been forgotten.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I know that's selfish...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I wanted to ignore my feelings.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But I couldn't stop it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's heartbreaking!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      WHAT'S heartbreaking?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's been all by himself at the edge
      of the universe.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You don't feel sad for him?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Imagine how long he was here...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Imagine how lonely he was!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      IT'S. HIS. JOB.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Don't be so cruel!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's just looking for attention!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Stop it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Have some compassion!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Look, I can't help it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      When I see him, I get this weird
      feeling inside...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I feel like I know him, but I've NEVER
      seen him before.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      How's that possible?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What's wrong?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I-It's nothing!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's clear the debris and keep
      following him!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      This way.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He went that way!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's go!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is what he wants!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's just toying with us.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What a jerk!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We're close. We have to catch him!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Fine, I agree with you, but I don't
      have to like it.<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      This place is harsh.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's constantly under tension, like a
      stormy sea.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      All it takes is one small gap, one
      missed moment...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's all it takes for a tiny tear
      between the dimensions to form!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I tried my best to seal it up.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But I was too depressed.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This Ex guy...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I don't think he's running away
      from us.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think he's... leading us somewhere!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I agree.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Why is he telling us these stories on
      the way?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm not sure...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Tee, you alright?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What're you thinking?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, nothing.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You've been quiet this whole time.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You don't seem to be sympathizing
      with Ex.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are you up to something?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh no!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Look, more Puyos and Tetriminos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's focus on getting rid of them!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You and me, we got it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Though it seems like you're
      dodging my question!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      We should overtake Ex very soon.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Tee!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No time, Ringo. Let's hurry!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, why won't you answer me...?<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      You made it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We got you now, Ex!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Indeed, you have.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Welcome, to the farthest edge of
      spacetime.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We are at the border between the
      worlds.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Answer me.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We followed you this far. What's your
      game?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I want you to battle me. ...And I want
      you to win.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What's your angle?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I was careless before.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I need to be reminded of why my job
      is important.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I want to fight the Tetris King and
      feel that once more.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Otherwise, I might give in to
      hopelessness again.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So that's what you want?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's all.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And don't hold back, Tetris King!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Very well.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Prepare for battle, Keeper!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Thank you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The Tetriminos and the Puyos have
      vanished.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And you've made me remember...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'll return to my post now.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      About that, Ex...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I want to swap places with you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What did you say!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You said you were lonely.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So let me take over as the Keeper of
      Dimensions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Seriously!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Seriously!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Seriously!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      SERIOUSLY!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, the former King was able to do
      it, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So surely I'm qualified too...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, are you mad!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Quite the opposite.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm a responsible person, and I'm up
      to the task.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's not the point!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, no...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You'll be stuck here, alone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do you realize what that means...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I do.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But if it's not me, then it's Ex.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We can't leave him behind like this.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is the only way.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And it's for Ess's sake.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm going to let you, Tee.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Then face me, Keeper! If I win, you
      do as I say!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You don't know what you're getting
      yourself into...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yes, I do! Now, you were holding
      back earlier.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This time, I want the real thing.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Fine. I'll show you what I can
      really do.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Brace yourself, Tee.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      TETRIS BATTLE!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      I told you. I'm the true Tetris King.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      H-How'd he beat me...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Listen to me, Ex.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I will be the Keeper now.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi! Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm sorry, O.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Pipi-Pi...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is mad.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      STOP!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What now...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I won't let you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Why not?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I know what I'm doing. It's the only
      way to help Ex.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You are so IRRITATING!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This isn't a solution!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Neither of you should have to sit here
      for eternity!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's not the best solution, but it's
      the only one we've got.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No! Ringo's right!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There has to be some other way!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And together, we'll find it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We have friends on so many
      worlds...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's true! Someone will know the
      answer!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ess and I have gotten so close...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We'll work together to solve this!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're wrong! You and I aren't really
      that close at all!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But she's right about the other stuff,
      Tee. Let's think about this.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You just don't get it, do you?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      FINE! I'll have to beat some sense
      into you!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      R-Ringo...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'M GOING TO FIGHT YOU WITH
      PUYO PUYO!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...AND TETRIS!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Alright! I did it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I won!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo? Why...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, Ex, you both need to stop acting
      so weird.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, listen up, everyone!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We don't want Ex to be lonely, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So why don't we just make plans to
      come visit a lot!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I mean, like, a whole lot!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Amitie... *head-shake*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Did this girl smack her brain on
      something back there...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What!? HEY!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's a nice idea, Amitie, but this
      is the farthest edge of spacetime.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Only those with the power to cross
      dimensions can reach this place.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And the Keeper's not allowed
      to leave. Ever.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh... okay... So back to the drawing
      board?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *sigh* We never LEFT the drawing
      board.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, okay.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We need a better idea!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There isn't a better idea. It's the
      Keeper's fate to remain alone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's a life of solitude.
      It's hopeless.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, come, surely it isn't entirely
      hopeless...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I know that voice!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      MWAHAHAHAHA!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      NOTHING is hopeless when you're the
      Dark Prince!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What're you doing here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gu-Gu-Gu-Gugu-Gu?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm here too, Ringo~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ecolo...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I have the power to cross dimensional
      boundaries.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And this guy's got some really wicked
      dark magic.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So together, we made a warp tunnel
      from the Tetra to this place!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That sounds ridiculously simple!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Mwahaha...! Are you impressed?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Think of it as a gift from the Dark
      Prince.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...A gift to my precious Arly and
      Carbunny~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I don't know what to say...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You could say that I'm handsome and
      wise... and the perfect catch, no?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gu...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I don't know about all that.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But I'm definitely really happy about
      all this!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That smile!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now that I've seen her smile,
      I'll never wash these eyeballs
      ever again...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And thank you too, Ecolo.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, Ringo...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do I perhaps get a little more than
      just a smile...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... no.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Ecolo, don't be so needy.
      Girls don't like it.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... really? Advice from you?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee! Ex! This is fantastic!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now no one will have to be lonely!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Amitie...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I still have some doubts about this
      warp tunnel.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But it sounds like a good solution
      for now, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now we can come visit any time...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'd like that, Ess.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thank you, everyone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thank you so much!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I should restore the dimensional
      boundary now.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      W-Wait, that means... all of us...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yes.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I suggest you each say your
      goodbyes.<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
