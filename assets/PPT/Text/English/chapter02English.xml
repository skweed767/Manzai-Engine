    <text>
      Bye, Ringo! See you later!<arrow />

    <text>
      Oh, hey, Maguro! What's up?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We missed you in class! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Where've you been...? ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No biggie, just a little trip aboard
      a starship!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wow~! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm jealous! ★ Sounds like a cool
      adventure! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yeah, it kinda was.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So what's up? Need something?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, this huge object just landed
      on top of the school roof. ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And there's a boy up there, too...
      with super-tight clothes! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I had a feeling if ANYONE knew
      something, it'd be you! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What did you say...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's... That's gotta be Tee!<arrow />

    <text>
      The Starship Tetra has landed on
      an unidentified world.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ship status: Very broken.
      Crew status: Very missing.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pi-Pi...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hm?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Captain Tee?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo! Are you alright?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh no... the Tetra!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's... well, it's... It's pretty
      beat up...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Plus, my crew appears to be missing.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo, I think there's only one
      logical course.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do you think you can help me
      with something? Something
      very important...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Absotively!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Whatever you need!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I need to blow off steam. You still
      want to learn to clear Tetriminos?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Aw, you remembered...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's easy. Just make a solid line,
      and they'll clear!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's some other stuff, like Tetris
      Line Clears and Back-to-Backs and
      T-Spins...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But I'm sure you'll figure it all out,
      EASY-PEASY!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *giggle*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now then... Are you ready?<arrow />

      TETRIS BATTLE!<arrow />

    <text>
      Whew!<arrow />

    <text>
      You feeling better now?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think so. Thanks.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's focus on recon.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I don't know what "recon" is, but I'll
      tag along... We should look for your
      crew!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You sure? You don't have anything
      else to take care of?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nope!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This is actually my hometown.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Out of all the planets... What are
      the odds!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And as a resident, it's my job to
      show you around!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Plus, I owe you, since you were a
      gentleman and brought me home!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So let's go find your crew!<arrow />

    <text>
      What a spectacle.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      For a moment there, I was convinced
      you were...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No wait, hold on... What ARE you...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi-Pipi...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh, that's just Risukuma!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He's in the Physics Club with me.
      He's a pro at popping Puyos!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are there... many like him on this
      planet?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nope! He's one of a kind! Special
      edition! Limited run!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Ris!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Why, hello there, Ringo.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What're you thinkin' about?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, I saw something most
      unconventional over there.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What was it?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm led to believe... a trembling
      chihuahua? Walking upright?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...And the most exceedingly
      out-of-shape robot ever.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Am I thinking what you're
      thinking...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That has to be Ai and Zed! We know
      those two!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's move out!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      W-Wait a moment. Just a sec...
      I'd like to join.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'd like to observe how this all plays
      out just a bit more closely.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There... there...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Who is a good doggy? That is correct...
      nothing to fear...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Rrrrufff! Rrrufff!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee should arrive soon to help us.
      Just remember, who is a good
      doggy?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *whine*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think I found 'em.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It's not every day you see a chihuahua
      sitting in a robot's lap.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Can I take a picture with you?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo, this is hardly the occasion
      for that. We don't know if he's had
      his shots.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ai! Zed! You're all in one piece!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ah, Captain, I am pleased to see you
      are in only one piece, yourself.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Zed, status report.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      As you can see, Ai is afraid of this
      alien world.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Rrruff! YIP! YIP! Rrruff! Rruff!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Aw, looks like he needs a belly
      rub! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Captain, I have not been successful
      at calming him down.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Say, Ringo, maybe you could give it
      a try?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Whoa! Talk about delegating!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Just leave it to me!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let me show you that my hometown
      really is a safe place!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's only one way to calm you
      down...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      MEEP!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's battle!<arrow />

    <text>
      YIP! YIP! YIP!<arrow />

    <text>
      Young lady, I am in your debt.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You stopped this from being one of
      those... dog day afternoons.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *chuckle*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This chihuahua doesn't make sense,
      does he?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, does your whole crew look like
      him?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No, he's... one of a kind! Special
      edition! Limited run!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ai! Zed! The SS Tetra is damaged.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And the rest of the crew is
      unaccounted for.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi-Pipi! Pi-Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I saw Jay and Elle earlier.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You don't say...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Actually, I do, Captain.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      THEY WERE TRYING TO SEE
      HOW MUCH MISCHIEF THEY
      COULD GET INTO!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      AND THEN THEY SKIPPED OFF,
      HAND-IN-HAND!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That sounds like those two.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We need to find them before they
      cause any trouble.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      This sounds bad!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We should hurry, Tee!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I agree! Let's move out!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Best of luck, gang.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Zed and I will take a look at the
      Tetra.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Sounds like a proper task for an
      engineer, after all...<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Whoaaaa...! So many people, Elle!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Totally, Jay!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Where is this place...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What is this place?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I got an idea... Hahaha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I got one too... Hahaha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Before the Captain finds us…<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...let's see which of us can cause more
      trouble!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Time for a... MISCHIEF BATTLE!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There they are!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's grab them!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I think they're talking about us!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Hey, they caught you! Hahaha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You're totally under arrest! Hahaha!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Are you for real?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You two ran off just to go play
      pranks...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Nope, nope, nope.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yep! Someone brought us here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yep! They said they wanted to cause
      mayhem!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      "Mayhem"...? That doesn't sound
      so good.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-Who brought you here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      A girl with curly-curly, pink hair~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      A lady with wavy-wavy, blue hair~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *thinking sounds*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Those descriptions sound...
      somewhat familiar.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, shouldn't you be looking
      for Ess?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Where is she? Have you seen her!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      N-yep!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She went over that way!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Okay, we need to find her.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi! Pipi! Pipipi-Pi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Aaaanyhow, maybe I should head
      back.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'll go with you and keep you safe!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That sounds like a bad idea.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, Maguro...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Don't worry, Ringo! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'll make sure these two get back to
      the starship with zero-to-minimal
      detours. ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What!? "Minimal detours"...? That's
      not fair!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yeah, we didn't agree to that!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ya want something to complain about,

      get into this situation?<arrow />

      I-I didn't know she had a softer side

    </text>
    <text>
      Helped WHAT exactly?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It didn't help the fact you're a
      useless captain, did it?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It didn't UN-crash the Tetra
      or UN-strand me on an alien
      homeworld, did it?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You should be glad I'm even speaking
      to you!<arrow />

    </text>
    <text>
      Yep, we're practically family...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipi~pipi~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So, Ess, how'd you end up here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Actually, I'm not sure...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There was this girl with a crooked
      stick in each hand...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I kind of followed her... She was just
      shouting "Hyahhh!"<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And when we got here, she was
      gone!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You know what...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      All these descriptions keep sounding
      vaguely familiar...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Who cares! My turn to ask
      questions!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      What is it?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You found the crew, right?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Is Papa safe...? Is he? Please, tell me
      Papa's safe!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um, "Papa"?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We didn't meet Ess's dad, did we?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He has a big, round body and an even
      bigger heart!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You mean... Zed!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      My Papa!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-You know he's a robot, right!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Of course she knows he's a robot.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do you have a problem with Papa?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      N-No, it sounds completely,
      biologically routine!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You ask strange questions.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, let's all head back now! Your
      Papa's waiting, Ess.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Tee, you're going to go along with
      this narrative!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Not that there's anything wrong
      with it, of course.<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      And... we're here!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Welcome to "here"! ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We're here too!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We decided to come back and wait for
      you guys!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugugu~!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There were introductions earlier.
      It was all very cordial, I assure you.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Great, so everyone's acquainted
      now!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And the Tetra looks like it's in much
      better shape.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ai, how is she? All fixed up?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Certainly. This Risukuma fellow has
      proven quite helpful, actually.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We combined our shared know-how
      while you were gone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And I think you'll find much of the
      Tetra's functionality has been
      restored.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Kwaaahrrrgh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gmuwrglwrughhffff!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? Ris? What's wrong?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ah, don't worry, he's just excited. ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      He gets this way when he's doing
      science... ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's leave him be. ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Mrwahhhhwahhhh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Oh... okay... well, that all seems
      perfectly normal.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      More importantly, are we ready to
      depart, Ai?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Not quite, Captain. There's a few
      complications...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      In particular, we won't be able to
      travel any great distance.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We need some special parts to
      properly fix the Tetra.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I cannot allow that!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh...!? Th-That voice...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, why're YOU yelling?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do you know who that is?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's no way I'd mistake that
      voice!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      There's only one possibility...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      RAFFINA!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Silence.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The boundary shall fall. The two
      worlds WILL merge.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And if you stand in my way, I shall
      kick you. Really, super hard.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Who in the heck...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I hate arrogant, spoiled, stuck-up,
      self-entitled girls! BLEH!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do you see what WE have to deal with
      now, Ess?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Pipipi-Pipi!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      No, no, no! Guys, this is Raffina!
      She's my friend!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      HEY! That's the sleazebin who
      tricked us!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She's not just a bin, she's
      a sleazewagon!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What are you two talking
      about...?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wait, Raffina, why're your eyes so
      scary?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And... "merging two worlds"?
      That's not how you USUALLY talk.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I shall have to demonstrate then.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let us battle... Puyo Puyo AND Tetris!
      TOGETHER!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      TH-THAT'S NOT EVEN A THING!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      That battle was craaazy. Raffina was
      craaazy!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What's going on here?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo! ★ Are you okay? ★<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Huh? Oh, Maguro!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We should get out of here.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We need to figure out what's
      happening.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I won't allow that.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Who asked you!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, wait, it's YOU!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's correct. I'm me.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The super-duper, hairy-scary,
      evil-weevil, weirdy-wacky,
      gothy-girl!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, she's the one that made ME
      get lost.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The girl with the crooked sticks!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eh? Crooked what-now...? You gotta
      workshop those adjectives, hun.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Eeheehee...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      The two worlds shall become one.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That... is... fate.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ringo, is this how she normally is?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... well... er...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I mean, it's not TOO far off!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She's usually rather dark, but not
      quite so... aggressive.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She is weird, though. That part's
      definitely normal.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      HYYYYAH!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Not cool! No attacking during a
      side-conversation!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Carby, this whole situation is
      getting outta hand!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugugu...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Something weird's gotten into Feli
      and Raffina.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Plus, there's those Tetriminos
      raining down.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      And we got simultaneous Puyo Puyo
      AND Tetris battles.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We're cursed. Everywhere we go,
      weird stuff happens!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I have a really bad feeling... We need to
      stop them, whatever they're up to.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Do NOT try and stop me.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You gotta be kidding me!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      It can't be...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Rulue? You too...!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Out of my way.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...Or I'll blow you to smithereens.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wh-What are you saying!?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We will battle with Tetriminos.
      We will battle with Puyos.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wait, but why? You normally just like
      Puyos...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, are you even listening?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Gugu! Gugugu!<arrow />
    </text>
  </sheet>
  <sheet>
    <text>
      Rrgh...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I shall return.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Just you wait and see.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      H-Hold on! Raffina!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Rulue!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      They're gone.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Hey, guys! Jay, Elle, Ess...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Were those the people who tricked
      you?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Yes, that's correct.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      That's correct, yes.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I swear, I'm not lying.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm not lying, I swear.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      My sensors believe they are telling
      the truth.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I see...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'm positive too. That was the girl
      with the sticks.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      N-No, there's no way that's true.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Raffina would never cause mischief.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Amitie...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She wouldn't...! She wouldn't...!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      She isn't capable of mischief!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      ...I mean, unless there was some shiny
      jewelry at stake or something!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... Hey...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Y-Yeah, that's not really helping
      your case, Amitie.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Then, what's happening?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Something is definitely off.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Five minutes with Rulue, and she didn't
      mention the Dark Prince ONCE.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      THAT'S your method of gauging
      crazy?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      *thinking sounds*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I apologize for butting in like this...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But perhaps this isn't a problem we
      can solve right now.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Why not address the solvable
      problems first?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Thanks, Ai. You have a point.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      You were saying that there's a way to
      repair the Tetra?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Indeed, there is.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I'll let Mr. Risukuma elaborate.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Wrrmrghoh!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      U-Use your words, Ris. Use your
      words.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Ah, yes, that's much better. Pardon
      me. *throat clear*<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Now, I've run some calculations...<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Your starship's flight capabilities 
      are severely limited.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      But we can rebuild her. We have the
      technology. ...It's around here
      somewhere.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We just need special parts from up in
      the sky.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      So we just get the right parts, and
      the Tetra's all good?<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      According to my calculations, yes.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Well, let's do it!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I've written down the details. Please
      disregard the doodle.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      One more thing: We can't hold much
      fuel or water.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      I propose we don't all attempt to
      board the Tetra together.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Let's make several trips, two or three
      of us in varying combinations.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Or we'll run out of fuel and be trapped
      in space forever and ever.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Um... yeah, let's avoid that.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      We have no choice. Our path is clear.<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Excellent! Let's you and I go first!<arrow />
    </text>
    <text>
      Prepare to depart at once.<arrow />
    </text>
